# REACT - Update User-Profile Page 
### REACT & Firebase, Localstorage

#### Fetching and Updating data 
> This is a simple project about localstorage, fetching and updating data from firebase</br>
> The exercise in this project was:</br>
>> Fetch Data</br>
>> Update data </br>
>> Update profile pic</br>
>> Use localstorage</br>
>> Store the State</br>

#### Firebase
> In the Utils Folder, you will find all files related to Firebase</br>
>> There is a user_DATA.js file for Firestore db in case you want to create your own.</br>

#### React APP
> Run the app from the main folder - npm start</br>
> runs on localhost:3000</br>


#### Credit
> I want to give credit to **Kent C. Dodds** </br>
> I got the idea to this project from one of Kent C. Dodds exercises in his Epic-React Course.</br>
> I took his exercise, turned it completly around and put Firestore behind it. (as I do :-)</br>
